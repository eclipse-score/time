Time Feature Architecture

This page defines the static and dynamic architecture of the :need:`feat__time` feature
(:term:`score::time`). The feature overview, logical interfaces, and requirements are
described in the platform repository.

Static Architecture
-------------------

The feature-wide static view shows the Time feature, the three clock interfaces
it exposes, and the SW components that implement them:

* **score::time** (clock library) — ``Clock<Tag>`` API exposing
  :term:`Vehicle Clock`, :term:`Local Clock`, and :term:`Absolute Clock`
* **TimeDaemon** — PTP time validation and distribution process
* **TimeSlave** — gPTP slave endpoint that receives network time
* **ts_client** — shared-memory IPC client connecting ``VehicleClock`` to
  ``TimeDaemon``

Dynamic Architecture
--------------------

Vehicle Time
************

The :term:`Vehicle Clock` exposes two runtime interaction modes: a **pull** model — reading the
latest accumulated snapshot on demand — and an **event notification** model — subscribing to
receive notifications when new data arrives.

.. rubric:: Reading the time

Applications read the current vehicle time through the :term:`Vehicle Clock` (``now``). In the
background the time is continuously synchronized to the external network time
(:term:`PTP protocol`), validated, and accumulated as a snapshot. The read uses the latest
accumulated snapshot and interpolates it on the current local monotonic clock — a fast local
operation that does not cross the process boundary.

   :safety: ASIL_B

   :belongs_to: feat__time[version==1]

   .. uml:: _assets/vehicle_time_read_flow.puml
      :scale: 50
      :align: center

.. rubric:: Receiving notifications

Applications can subscribe to :term:`Vehicle Clock` events. Subscription is the only way to obtain
the PTP payload data (the sync/follow-up and pdelay sequences, which are independent); the
:term:`Vehicle Time status` can also be read from ``now``, and subscription additionally delivers
it as it changes. The primary use case is diagnostics — reacting to a status change or a PTP data
update in a diagnostic manner.

   :belongs_to: feat__time[version==1]

   .. uml:: _assets/vehicle_time_notification.puml
      :scale: 50
      :align: center

Local Time
**********

All three local clock domains share the same ``now`` interface and resolve directly to an OS
clock read — no initialization or background synchronization is required. The domain is selected
at construction time and is always available.

Absolute Time
*************

Absolute time is delivered from an external time master through the ``score::someip`` stack. Each
sample carries a :term:`Delay Tag` so the transmission delay can be compensated. The
:term:`score::time` feature converts the :term:`Delay Tag` to a local monotonic tag before
publishing, so the :term:`Absolute Clock` compensates the delay on the local monotonic base —
preserving precision without making clients depend on the :term:`Vehicle Clock`.

Mocking Support
---------------

The :term:`score::time` feature provides a mockable interface for each clock domain —
:term:`Vehicle Clock`, :term:`Local Clock` and :term:`Absolute Clock`. Application developers
can substitute any clock interface with a controlled implementation during testing, enabling
deterministic unit, component and integration tests of time-dependent code without requiring
a real time source (:need:`feat_req__time__mocking_apis`).
