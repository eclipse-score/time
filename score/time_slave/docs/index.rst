Abstract
========

This component implements a gPTP (IEEE 802.1AS) time synchronization slave daemon that receives time synchronization data from network and publishes it to IPC for client applications.

Specification
=============

The time_slave component provides IEEE 802.1AS synchronization pipeline that receives gPTP network messages, computes local clock correction values, and publishes synchronized time snapshots via ts_client shared memory IPC.

Runtime flow follows continuous loop:

1. **Initialization and setup**: Bind configured network interface, initialize gPTP engine and IPC publisher, enable hardware timestamping when platform supports it.
2. **Protocol processing**: Filter by configured gPTP domain, process Sync and Follow_Up pairs, compute offset and peer delay from protocol timestamps and correction fields.
3. **Clock adjustment and status tracking**: Apply PHC step or frequency adjustment based on offset behavior, detect synchronization timeout and forward/backward time leaps.
4. **Publishing**: Publish synchronized time snapshot, peer delay, rate deviation, and status flags to IPC at fixed 50 millisecond interval.

Key Behaviors
-------------

**Timestamping Strategy**: Hardware timestamping preferred; software timestamping fallback used when hardware capabilities are unavailable.

**Clock Control Strategy**: Large offset handled by step adjustment; stable offset evolution handled by frequency slew adjustment.

**Fault and Quality Flags**: Timeout status set when no valid Sync/Follow_Up pair is processed within configured timeout window. Time leap future and time leap past flags track forward and backward master time discontinuities.

**Diagnostics**: Optional runtime instrumentation can record synchronization events into CSV output when diagnostics option is enabled.

**Platform Support**: Linux and QNX 8.0 SDP supported for raw Ethernet, timestamp acquisition, and PHC control.

**Error Reporting**: Initialization, network, protocol, and timestamping fallback events are logged via score::mw::log.

Assumptions of Use
------------------

Users must configure and bring up network interface before starting time_slave. Exactly one time_slave instance per network interface is supported.
