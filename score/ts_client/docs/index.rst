Abstract
========

This component provides IPC mechanisms for time synchronization data exchange between time daemons and client applications within an ECU.

Specification
=============

The ts_client component provides shared memory IPC channel for gPTP time synchronization data exchange between one publisher and multiple readers within ECU.

Channel lifecycle follows producer-consumer model:

1. **Channel setup**: Publisher creates shared memory channel and Receiver opens existing channel in read-only mode.
2. **Validation and synchronization**: Receiver validates shared memory region on open, then reads data through lock-free synchronization with concurrent write detection.
3. **Data exchange**: Channel carries synchronization status, Sync/FollowUp metadata, PDelay metadata, and time correlation data for downstream processing.

Key Behaviors
-------------

**Lock-Free Multi-Reader Access**: Multiple readers can access same shared memory channel concurrently while single publisher writes.

**Data Integrity Handling**: Receiver reports invalid or corrupted reads when integrity checks fail.

**Platform Support**: Shared memory IPC flow supported on Linux and QNX 8.0 SDP.

**Error Reporting**: Shared memory create/open/validation failures are logged via score::mw::log.

**Cache-Aware Layout**: Shared memory layout is optimized to reduce cache contention between writer and readers.

Assumptions of Use
------------------

Only one publisher process may open and write given shared memory segment. Users must configure permissions so publisher has write access and readers have read access.
